## Curio Space

**Curio Space** is a generative discovery game where any subject is transformed into a navigable map of infinite possibilities. Powered by Gemini API, the system takes a single topic and procedurally generates a 2D coordinate system, allowing for the exploration of the "latent space" of human knowledge and AI imagination. Rather than inventing fictional items, the system acts as a **Perspective Architect**, recontextualizing iconic entities to reveal the hidden logic of a subject.

### The Experience

The goal of **Curio Space** is cumulative discovery. It functions as a digital cabinet of curiosities where the user acts as both the explorer and the cartographer. By repeatedly picking points, the user builds a unique atlas of a chosen topic, revealing how the AI categorizes the world. Whether the system produces a factual entry or a bizarre hybrid, the resulting map provides a one-of-a-kind visual representation of a conceptual universe.
### Technical Philosophy

- **No Hallucinations:** The system avoids "fictional filler." If a coordinate represents a logical impossibility, the AI identifies it as a "Boundary Paradox" and explains why that specific intersection cannot exist in reality.
- **Evocative Over Scientific:** The AI prioritizes poetic, lateral-thinking categories over dry taxonomic precision, creating "aha moments" of discovery.
- **Persistent Cartography:** Every discovery is plotted on a shared board, allowing the user to gradually build a complete conceptual atlas of the chosen subject.
