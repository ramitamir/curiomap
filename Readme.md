## Curio Space

**Curio Space** is a generative discovery game where any subject is transformed into a navigable map of infinite possibilities. Powered by Gemini API, the system takes a single topic and procedurally generates a 2D coordinate system, allowing for the exploration of the "latent space" of human knowledge and AI imagination.Rather than inventing fictional items, the system acts as a **Perspective Architect**, recontextualizing iconic entities to reveal the hidden logic of a subject.

### The Mechanics

1. **Select a Subject:** The user inputs a broad category (e.g., "Japanese Aesthetics," "Classic Cinema," or "Macroeconomics").
2. **Generate the Lens:** The AI defines two high-contrast axes. These are not just descriptors; they are a philosophical lens through which to view the topic.
3. **Map the Icons:** As the user selects $(x, y)$ coordinates, the system identifies **well-known cultural archetypes** that fit the point.
4. **The "Aha" Justification:** The system provides a brief rationale explaining why that specific item occupies that coordinate. The goal is to surprise the user with a logical connection they hadn't previously considered.

### Technical Philosophy

- **No Hallucinations:** The system avoids "fictional filler." If a coordinate represents a logical impossibility, the AI identifies it as a "Boundary Paradox" and explains why that specific intersection cannot exist in reality.
- **Persistent Cartography:** Every discovery is plotted on a shared board, allowing the user to gradually build a complete conceptual atlas of the chosen subject.

### The Experience

The goal of **Curio Space** is cumulative discovery. It functions as a digital cabinet of curiosities where the user acts as both the explorer and the cartographer. By repeatedly picking points, the user builds a unique atlas of a chosen topic, revealing how the AI categorizes the world. Whether the system produces a factual entry or a bizarre hybrid, the resulting map provides a one-of-a-kind visual representation of a conceptual universe.
